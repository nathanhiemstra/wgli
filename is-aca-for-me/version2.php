	<p><strong>An “adult child” is someone who meets the demands of life with survival techniques learned as children.</strong> Without help, we unknowingly operate with ineffective thoughts and judgments that can sabotage our decisions and relationships.</p>

	<p>The only requirement in <acronym title="Adult Children of Alcoholics">ACA</acronym> is a desire to recover from the effects of growing up in a dysfunctional home, regardless of whether or not alcohol was a factor. There are no screening committees, questionnaires, or waiting periods to join. You are an <acronym title="Adult Children of Alcoholics">ACA</acronym> member when you say you are.</p>

	<ol class="list-normal">
		<li>We became isolated and afraid of people and authority figures.</li>
		<li>We became approval seekers and lost our identity in the process.</li>
		<li>We are frightened of angry people and any personal criticism.</li>
		<li>We either become alcoholics, marry them or both, or find another compulsive personality such as a workaholic to fulfill our sick abandonment needs.</li>
		<li>We live life from the viewpoint of victims and we are attracted by that weakness in our love and friendship relationships.</li>
		<li>We have an overdeveloped sense of responsibility and it is easier for us to be concerned with others rather than ourselves; this enables us not to look too closely at our own faults, etc.</li>
		<li>We get guilt feelings when we stand up for ourselves instead of giving in to others.</li>
		<li>We became addicted to excitement.</li>
		<li>We confuse love and pity and tend to "love" people we can "pity" and "rescue."</li>
		<li>We have "stuffed" our feelings from our traumatic childhoods and have lost the ability to feel or express our feelings because it hurts so much (Denial).</li>
		<li>We judge ourselves harshly and have a very low sense of self-esteem.</li>
		<li>We are dependent personalities who are terrified of abandonment and will do anything to hold on to a relationship in order not to experience painful abandonment feelings, which we received from living with sick people who were never there emotionally for us.</li>
		<li>Alcoholism is a family disease; and we became para-alcoholics and took on the characteristics of that disease even though we did not pick up the drink.</li>
		<li>Para-alcoholics are reactors rather than actors.</li>
