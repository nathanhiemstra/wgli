<h1>Is <acronym title="Adult Children of Alcoholics">ACA</acronym> for Me?</h1>

<div class="summary">
	
	<p><strong>An “adult child” is someone who meets the demands of life with survival techniques learned as children.</strong> Without help, we unknowingly operate with ineffective thoughts and judgments that can sabotage our decisions and relationships.</p>

	<p>The only requirement in <acronym title="Adult Children of Alcoholics">ACA</acronym> is a desire to recover from the effects of growing up in a dysfunctional home, <strong>regardless of whether or not alcohol was a factor</strong>. There are no screening committees, questionnaires, or waiting periods to join. You are an <acronym title="Adult Children of Alcoholics">ACA</acronym> member when you say you are.</p>

	<div class="home-callout" id="laundry-list-anchor">
		<p><strong>We commonly identify with these 14 traits (the "Laundry List") that describe the effects of being raised in an alcoholic or dysfunctional family:</strong> </p>
		<ol class="list-normal">
			<li>We became isolated and afraid of people and authority figures.</li>
			<li>We became approval seekers and lost our identity in the process.</li>
			<li>We are frightened of angry people and any personal criticism.</li>
			<li>We either become alcoholics, marry them or both, or find another compulsive personality such as a workaholic to fulfill our sick abandonment needs.</li>
			<li>We live life from the viewpoint of victims and we are attracted by that weakness in our love and friendship relationships.</li>
			<li>We have an overdeveloped sense of responsibility and it is easier for us to be concerned with others rather than ourselves; this enables us not to look too closely at our own faults, etc.</li>
			<li>We get guilt feelings when we stand up for ourselves instead of giving in to others.</li>
			<li>We became addicted to excitement.</li>
			<li>We confuse love and pity and tend to "love" people we can "pity" and "rescue."</li>
			<li>We have "stuffed" our feelings from our traumatic childhoods and have lost the ability to feel or express our feelings because it hurts so much (Denial).</li>
			<li>We judge ourselves harshly and have a very low sense of self-esteem.</li>
			<li>We are dependent personalities who are terrified of abandonment and will do anything to hold on to a relationship in order not to experience painful abandonment feelings, which we received from living with sick people who were never there emotionally for us.</li>
			<li>Alcoholism is a family disease; and we became para-alcoholics and took on the characteristics of that disease even though we did not pick up the drink.</li>
			<li>Para-alcoholics are reactors rather than actors.</li> 
		</ol>
		<p><strong>Identification with some or all of these traits provides a starting point of recovery for each adult child looking for help.</strong> </p>

	<!-- <h2>Types of homes that commonly produce <acronym title="Adult Children of Alcoholics">ACA</acronym>s</h2>

	<p>You may have had an alcoholic parent, but even if you didn’t, a grandparent may have been an alcoholic and passed on the disease of family dysfunction to your parents. </p>

	<p>If alcohol was not a problem, your home may still have been chaotic, unsafe, and lacking nurture for a number of reasons, such as dysfunctions caused by food, sex, workaholism, ultra-religiousness, or militarism. Many foster children, now adults, also relate to <acronym title="Adult Children of Alcoholics">ACA</acronym>.</p> -->
